# Shayari App 

Welcome to the Shayari app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev)!

## Get Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the App**

   To start the app in development mode, run:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   In the output, you'll find options to open the app in:
   
   - [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

   Start developing by editing the files in the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Project Reset

To reset the project to its initial state:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command moves the existing code to the **app-example** directory and creates a new, blank **app** directory for fresh development.
